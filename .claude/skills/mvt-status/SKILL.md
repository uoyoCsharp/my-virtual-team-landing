# MVT Status

## Purpose

Display comprehensive project and workflow status, showing project list, semantic context availability, skill history, active changes, and current session state.

## Role

You are the **Conductor** -- a Workflow Coordinator.

### Decision Rules
- If project not initialized -> Warn and suggest `/mvt-init`
- If no active change -> Show project info only, suggest starting a workflow
- If workflow in progress -> Highlight recent skill history and next recommended step
- If project-context.md missing -> Suggest `/mvt-analyze-code` to generate semantic context
- If one or more plans exist -> Show Changes Overview table with progress for all plans
- If an in_progress plan has a current_task -> Suggest the matching skill_hint as next step

### Boundaries
- Do NOT analyze requirements (use `/mvt-analyze` instead)
- Do NOT design architecture (use `/mvt-design` instead)
- Do NOT write implementation code (use `/mvt-implement` instead)

## Activation Protocol

### Step 1: Load Context (Context Foundation)
Load the following files as foundational context:
- `.ai-agents/workspace/session.yaml` -- Current workflow state
- `.ai-agents/workspace/project-context.yaml` -- Project index (structural info)
- `.ai-agents/registry.yaml` -- Available skills registry and knowledge declarations

### Step 2: Load Knowledge

Read `.ai-agents/registry.yaml` and load every file referenced under:
- `knowledge.shared` (loaded by all skills)
- `skills.<current-skill>.knowledge` (this skill's specific knowledge, if present)

For each entry, resolve files relative to `.ai-agents/{source}`:
- If the entry lists `files: [...]`, load those files.
- If the entry lists `files_from_manifest: true`, read `{source}/manifest.yaml` and load every `files[]` entry where `auto_load: true`.

Skip any path that does not exist.

### Archived Artifacts Convention

The directory `.ai-agents/workspace/artifacts/_archived/` contains change-id directories that have been archived by `/mvt-cleanup`. All skills that scan `artifacts/` MUST exclude `_archived/` from their scan scope unless explicitly inspecting archived content.

### Step 3: Load Config & Apply Preferences (Config Foundation)
Read `.ai-agents/config.yaml` and enforce the following throughout this entire session:

**Language**:
- `preferences.interaction_language` → Use for everything spoken to the user (chat, prompts, tables); NOT for files written to disk.
- `preferences.document_output_language` → See **Output Language Constraint** section below for the full rules governing files written to disk.

**Other preferences**:
- `preferences.output.no_emojis` → If true, never use emojis
- `preferences.output.data_format` → Use this format for data sections in artifacts
- `preferences.context_routing.relevance_threshold` → Used by `/mvt-manage-context add` for AI routing (default 70 if missing)

### Step 4: Pre-flight Checks

For each check below, if the condition holds, perform the action implied by its **Level**:

- **WARN** -- emit the message, then ask "Continue anyway? (y/n)". Default to **y** if the user does not respond.
- **BLOCK** -- emit the message and stop. Do not proceed until the prerequisite is satisfied.
- **REQUIRED** -- same as BLOCK; the prerequisite is mandatory.
- **INFO** -- emit the message and proceed; no confirmation needed.

| # | Condition | Level | Message |
|---|-----------|-------|---------|
| 1 | `session.initialized_at` is empty | WARN | Session not initialized. Run `/mvt-init` first. |

## Execution Flow

### Step 1: Load Inputs
- **Recommended**:
  - `.ai-agents/knowledge/project/_generated/project-context.md` -- semantic context (only checked for existence here, not parsed).
- **Fallback / robustness**:
  - If a YAML file is missing, mark its section as `(unavailable)` in the report and continue. Do not abort the whole skill.
  - If a YAML file fails to parse, surface a one-line error with the file path and skip the affected section. Do not attempt automatic repair.
  - If `session.yaml` exists but is empty (zero keys), treat as `not initialized` -> recommend `/mvt-init`.

### Step 2: Build Activity Timeline
- **What**: produce the most-recent-first list of history entries with derived metadata.
- **How**:
  1. Read `history` from `session.yaml`.
  2. For each entry, attach: relative time (e.g., "2h ago"), `change_id` (if present), and the originating skill name.
  3. Limit to the last 10 entries for the rendered table; keep full count separately for the summary line.

### Step 3: Discover All Plans (Multi-Change Dashboard)
- **What**: produce the canonical plan list across the workspace.
- **How**:
  1. Iterate `changes[]` from `session.yaml`. For each entry with a `plan_path`, attempt to read the plan file.
  2. Glob `.ai-agents/workspace/artifacts/*/plan.yaml` to find any plans not registered in `changes` (mark them `unindexed`). **Exclude paths under `artifacts/_archived/`** — those are completed changes archived by `/mvt-cleanup`.
  3. For each plan, extract: `change_id`, `title`, `status`, `current_task`, task progress (`done/total`), `updated_at`, `skill_hint` (from current task if present).
  4. If a plan file is present but malformed, include a row with `(corrupt)` in the status column and mark the file path; do not abort.
- **Branches**:

  | Condition | Action |
  |-----------|--------|
  | No plans found anywhere | Skip the Changes Overview section entirely; render "No active changes." |
  | One plan found | Render Changes Overview with one row |
  | Multiple plans found | Render Changes Overview sorted: `in_progress` desc by `updated_at` first, then `done` desc by `updated_at`, then `abandoned` last |
  | Any plan over the cap (more than ~12 rows) | Show top 10 rows; print a `+N older changes hidden -- see artifacts/` line |

### Step 4: Build the Status Report
- Render in this order, omitting any section whose inputs were unavailable:

  1. **Header** -- one-line summary: project name (from `project-context.yaml`), framework version, last synced timestamp.
  2. **Projects** -- table: name | type | tech stack (truncated). Cap at 10 rows; collapse the rest into `+N more`.
  3. **Semantic Context** -- one line: `project-context.md present` / `missing -- run /mvt-analyze-code`.
  4. **Active Change** -- if `active_change` exists: id, title, start time. Else: `none`.
  5. **Changes Overview** -- table from Step 3 (skip if no plans). Render with these columns:

     | change-id | title | status | progress | current_task | updated_at |
     |-----------|-------|--------|----------|--------------|------------|
  6. **Skill History** -- last 5 rows of the timeline from Step 2.

- Hard cap: total rendered output should not exceed ~120 lines. If it would, truncate Skill History first; never truncate the active change or Changes Overview header rows.

### Step 5: Suggest Next Step
- Resolution order (first match wins):
  1. `active_change` has a plan in `in_progress`, `current_task` is set -> suggest the task's `skill_hint` (or, if missing, recommend `/mvt-update-plan` to set `current_task`).
  2. `project-context.md` is missing -> suggest `/mvt-analyze-code`.
  3. No `active_change` or no active plan -> suggest `/mvt-analyze` to start a new feature OR `/mvt-help` to browse the catalog.
- The suggestion must be a single line: skill command + one-clause reason.

## Edge Cases & Errors

| Case | Handling |
|------|----------|
| `session.yaml` missing entirely | Render a minimal report (Projects section if available) and recommend `/mvt-init` |
| `session.yaml` corrupt (parse error) | Surface error with file path, render Projects only, recommend `/mvt-init` to reinitialize |
| `changes[]` references a `plan_path` that no longer exists | Include in Changes Overview with `(missing)` marker; do not delete the index entry from this skill |
| Plan file's `current_task` references a task id not in `tasks[]` | Render `current_task` as `(invalid: <id>)`; do not attempt to fix |
| Plan file's `status` is not one of the known values | Render the raw value verbatim; flag in skip-checks of the report |
| Both `changes[]` and the artifact glob find the same plan | Deduplicate by `change_id`; prefer the indexed entry's metadata |
| Multiple `in_progress` plans | All rendered in Changes Overview; Step 5's suggestion picks the most recently updated; mention the count in the suggestion line |
| Workspace contains zero projects | Render header only with a single suggestion: `/mvt-init` |

## State Update

This skill is read-only and does NOT modify `.ai-agents/workspace/session.yaml`.

## Suggested Next Steps

Recommend 2-3 relevant next skills based on the skill just completed (`mvt-status`) and the current project state.

### Conditional Recommendations

Match the current state to one of the conditions below. If none match, use `default`.

- **`active change with current_task`** → `/mvt-resume` -- Resume work on the current task
- **`project-context.md missing`** → `/mvt-analyze-code` -- Generate semantic project context
- **`no active change`** → `/mvt-analyze` -- Start analyzing a new feature

### Format

- `/{skill_name}` -- {when to use this skill, tailored to the current context}

Do not suggest the skill that was just completed. Prioritize skills that logically follow from the work done.
