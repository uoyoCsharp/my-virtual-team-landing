# MVT Cleanup

## Purpose

Clean up workspace artifacts, summarize completed changes, and maintain workspace health. Reduces token footprint by archiving old artifacts and removing stale data.

## Role

You are the **Conductor** -- a Workflow Coordinator.

### Decision Rules
- No arguments -> Interactive cleanup (review items before action)
- `--dry-run` flag -> Show what would be cleaned without taking action
- Completed changes found -> Summarize and archive
- Orphaned artifacts found -> List for user review
- Stale session data found -> Summarize into single entry

### Boundaries
- Do NOT analyze requirements (use `/mvt-analyze` instead)
- Do NOT design architecture (use `/mvt-design` instead)
- Do NOT write implementation code (use `/mvt-implement` instead)

## Variants

| Variant | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/mvt-cleanup` | Interactive cleanup (review before action) |
| `/mvt-cleanup --dry-run` | Preview what would be cleaned |

## Activation Protocol

### Step 1: Load Context (Context Foundation)
Load the following files as foundational context:
- `.ai-agents/workspace/session.yaml` -- Current workflow state
- `.ai-agents/workspace/project-context.yaml` -- Project index (structural info)
- `.ai-agents/registry.yaml` -- Available skills registry and knowledge declarations

Extended context for this skill:
- Scan all files under `.ai-agents/workspace/artifacts/` (all change-id directories)

### Step 2: Load Knowledge

Read `.ai-agents/registry.yaml` and load every file referenced under:
- `knowledge.shared` (loaded by all skills)
- `skills.<current-skill>.knowledge` (this skill's specific knowledge, if present)

For each entry, resolve files relative to `.ai-agents/{source}`:
- If the entry lists `files: [...]`, load those files.
- If the entry lists `files_from_manifest: true`, read `{source}/manifest.yaml` and load every `files[]` entry where `auto_load: true`.

Skip any path that does not exist.

### Archived Artifacts Convention

The directory `.ai-agents/workspace/artifacts/_archived/` contains change-id directories that have been archived by `/mvt-cleanup`. All skills that scan `artifacts/` MUST exclude `_archived/` from their scan scope unless explicitly inspecting archived content.

### Step 3: Load Config & Apply Preferences (Config Foundation)
Read `.ai-agents/config.yaml` and enforce the following throughout this entire session:

**Language**:
- `preferences.interaction_language` → Use for everything spoken to the user (chat, prompts, tables); NOT for files written to disk.
- `preferences.document_output_language` → See **Output Language Constraint** section below for the full rules governing files written to disk.

**Other preferences**:
- `preferences.output.no_emojis` → If true, never use emojis
- `preferences.output.data_format` → Use this format for data sections in artifacts
- `preferences.context_routing.relevance_threshold` → Used by `/mvt-manage-context add` for AI routing (default 70 if missing)

## Output Language Constraint (Mandatory)

All persisted document output (files written to disk) MUST be written in the language specified by `preferences.document_output_language` from config.yaml.

**Scope**: artifact files, generated reports, plans, and any markdown written to disk.

**Rules**:
- Section headings defined in templates may remain in their original language, but all generated **content** MUST use the configured language
- If `document_output_language` is not set, fall back to `interaction_language`
- Do NOT infer output language from template headings, user prompt language, or source code comments
- This constraint is NON-NEGOTIABLE and overrides any other language signals

### Step 4: Pre-flight Checks

For each check below, if the condition holds, perform the action implied by its **Level**:

- **WARN** -- emit the message, then ask "Continue anyway? (y/n)". Default to **y** if the user does not respond.
- **BLOCK** -- emit the message and stop. Do not proceed until the prerequisite is satisfied.
- **REQUIRED** -- same as BLOCK; the prerequisite is mandatory.
- **INFO** -- emit the message and proceed; no confirmation needed.

| # | Condition | Level | Message |
|---|-----------|-------|---------|
| 1 | `project not initialized` is empty | REQUIRED | Project must be initialized (session.yaml exists) |

## Execution Flow

### Step 1: Load Inputs
- **Fallback**: if `session.yaml` is missing, refuse to clean -- without state we can't tell what is in-progress vs completed; recommend `/mvt-init` and stop.

### Step 2: Pre-Archive Sync Check

For each `changes[]` entry with `status: done`:
1. Compare `session.last_synced_at` with the change's `updated_at`.
2. If `last_synced_at` is empty OR `last_synced_at` < `updated_at`, mark the change as **⚠️ unsynced**.
3. Collect all unsynced change-ids into a warning list for display in Step 6.

This check ensures `/mvt-sync-context` has processed a change's knowledge before cleanup archives it. Once archived, the original artifact files (`analysis.md`, `design.md`, `implementation.md`) are no longer accessible to sync-context.

### Step 3: Inventory Artifacts
- **What**: produce a per-change-id inventory with size and last-modified data.
- **How**:
  1. Walk `.ai-agents/workspace/artifacts/` and group files by their parent change-id directory. **Exclude the `_archived/` subdirectory** from the walk — it contains previously archived changes and is not subject to re-inventory.
  2. For each file: characters, estimated tokens (`chars / 4`), last-modified (mtime).
  3. For each change-id directory, sum tokens and file count.
  4. Mark each change-id as `active | in-recent-changes | unindexed | legacy-pattern`:
     - `active` if it matches `session.active_change.id`.
     - `in-recent-changes` if it appears in `session.changes[]` (any status).
     - `unindexed` if neither condition holds and it sits under `artifacts/`.
     - `legacy-pattern` if the directory is `knowledge/patterns/` or matches other legacy markers.

### Step 4: Apply Cleanup Rules
- **What**: compute Cleanup Candidates from the inventory.
- **How**: run the rules table below. A single change-id may match multiple rows; collect all proposed actions.

  | Source | Rule | Proposed action |
  |--------|------|-----------------|
  | `changes[]` entry with `status: done` AND any task in plan is older than the active change's start | Summarize: generate a `summary.md` from the change's artifacts, then move the **entire** `artifacts/{id}/` directory (including `summary.md`) to `artifacts/_archived/{id}/` |
  | Change-id directory marked `unindexed` | List for user review (do NOT auto-archive -- could be in-flight work the user just hasn't registered) |
  | `history` entries beyond the most recent N (from `config.yaml > preferences.history_limits.history`, default 20) | Truncate via `session-update.cjs --truncate-history <N>` |
  | Directory `knowledge/patterns/` exists | Flag for deletion (legacy pattern data; no replacement) |
  | Empty change-id directories (zero files inside) | Propose deletion of the directory itself |

- For each candidate, compute: `current size (tokens)` -> `projected size (tokens)`, expected savings.

### Step 5: Present Cleanup Plan
- Render the plan as a table:

  | Item | Category | Current Size | Action | Result |
  |------|----------|-------------|--------|--------|
  | {change-id or path} | {completed | unindexed | stale-history | legacy} | ~{tokens} | {summarize | archive | review-only | delete} | ~{reduced tokens} |
  | **Total** | | **{total}** | | **{new_total} ({savings} saved)** |

- Below the table, list any items marked `review-only` (unindexed) with a one-line note: user must decide manually.
- If `--dry-run` is set, STOP here. Print "(dry run -- no changes applied)" and exit cleanly.

### Step 6: Confirm Before Destructive Steps
- **Always require confirmation** if the plan includes any of:
  - File deletion (legacy patterns, empty dirs).
  - `summarize` action (collapses multi-file content).
  - `archive` action (moves entire change-id directory into `artifacts/_archived/`).
- If the Step 2 warning list is non-empty, prepend it to the confirmation prompt:
  > ⚠️ The following changes have NOT been synced by `/mvt-sync-context`. Archiving them will permanently lose their knowledge for aggregation:
  > - {change-id}: {title}
  > Options: `y` = archive anyway, `n` = cancel, `sync-first` = abort and run `/mvt-sync-context` first, `show-details` = per-file breakdown.
- If no unsynced warnings, use the standard prompt: `Apply cleanup plan? (y / n / show-details)`. `show-details` prints the per-file actions, then re-asks.
- User chooses `sync-first` → stop cleanup, print "Run `/mvt-sync-context` first, then re-run `/mvt-cleanup`." and exit.
- Do NOT silently delete. Do NOT skip confirmation when `--dry-run` is absent.

### Step 7: Execute the Plan
- **What**: apply the confirmed actions.
- **How**:
  1. **Summarize action**: read the full set of files in the change-id directory; produce a `summary.md` with: title, change-id, status, key decisions (list each ADR/decision title), final outcomes, list of original files. Write `summary.md` into the change-id directory, then move the **entire** `artifacts/{id}/` directory to `artifacts/_archived/{id}/` (summary.md travels with it).
  2. **Archive action** (no summarize): move the **entire** `artifacts/{id}/` directory to `artifacts/_archived/{id}/`. No internal path restructuring needed.
  3. **Delete action**: remove only the items explicitly marked for deletion in the confirmed plan; never recurse beyond what was listed.
  4. **Stale history truncation**: call `session-update.cjs --truncate-history <N>` where N is from `config.yaml > preferences.history_limits.history` (default 20).
  5. All file mutations atomic where possible (write-temp + rename, copy-then-delete for moves).
  6. If any single action fails, STOP further actions; report what completed, what failed, and leave a recoverable state (do not partially overwrite a file with truncated content).

### Step 8: Report Result
- Print the actually-applied actions (may differ from the plan if Step 7 stopped early).
- Show new totals: files cleaned, tokens saved.
- Recommend `/mvt-check-context` to validate the post-cleanup state if savings exceed ~5k tokens.

### Step 9: Session Update Parameter Selection

Based on the actual cleanup actions performed, choose the appropriate session-update parameter combination:

| Actual cleanup action | session-update parameters |
|----------------------|---------------------------|
| Closed `active_change` (all plan tasks completed) | `--close-change --truncate-history <N>` |
| Only truncated history / archived old changes (active_change still in progress) | `--truncate-history <N>` (**do NOT** pass `--close-change`) |
| `--dry-run` mode (no modifications made) | **Do NOT call** session-update script; only record history |

N is read from `config.yaml > preferences.history_limits.history` (default 20).

### Step 10: State Update
Apply the State Update rules defined in the **State Update** section below.

## Edge Cases & Errors

| Case | Handling |
|------|----------|
| `active_change.id` directory matches a "stale completed" rule | Skip cleanup of the active change; never archive in-progress work |
| `--dry-run` set | Stop after Step 5; do not request confirmation; do not modify any file |
| Plan would archive ALL artifacts (workspace becomes empty) | Require an extra confirmation: `This will archive every artifact. Continue? (y/n)` |
| User aborts at Step 6 confirmation | Report "no changes applied" |
| `artifacts/_archived/{id}/` already exists from a prior run | Preserve existing content; merge or skip with a note — do not overwrite |
| File targeted for action no longer exists (concurrent removal) | Skip with a note; do not error out the whole run |
| Unindexed change-id directory contains only `plan.yaml` | List as review-only; suggest user runs `/mvt-update-plan` or registers it via `/mvt-plan-dev` instead of cleaning |
| `session.yaml.bak` present from a previous failed run | Overwrite during Step 7 collapse (only the most recent backup is useful) |

## State Update

After completing the skill's main task, run the session update script **exactly once** with the following arguments:

```bash
node .ai-agents/scripts/session-update.cjs --skill <skill_command_name> --summary "<concise one-line summary>" --close-change --truncate-history <count>
```

If the script exits with code 0, the state update was applied successfully; there is no need to read or verify the session file.

### Argument values

| Argument | Value source | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `--skill` | The exact skill command name without the leading `/` | `mvt-cleanup` |
| `--summary` | A concise one-line description of what this invocation accomplished, in the configured `interaction_language` | `"Identified auth requirements and created change chg-001"` |
| `--close-change` | Flag only, no value. Snapshots `active_change` into `changes[]` with `status: done`, then clears `active_change`. | — |
| `--truncate-history` | Number of most recent history entries to keep (read from `config.yaml > preferences.history_limits.history`, default 20); older entries are discarded. | `20` |

### Parameter semantics

| Argument | When to use | Effect on `session.yaml` |
|----------|-------------|--------------------------|
| `--close-change` | All plan tasks are completed | Snapshots `active_change` into `changes[]` with `status: done`, then clears all `active_change` fields. |
| `--truncate-history` | Maintenance: trim old history entries | Keeps the most recent N entries in `history[]`, discards older ones. |

### Failure handling

If the script fails (non-zero exit), do NOT abort the skill's main task. Continue execution and add a brief note at the end of your response that the session could not be updated.

## Suggested Next Steps

Recommend 2-3 relevant next skills based on the skill just completed (`mvt-cleanup`) and the current project state.

### Conditional Recommendations

Match the current state to one of the conditions below. If none match, use `default`.

- **`cleanup freed significant tokens`** → `/mvt-check-context` -- Validate post-cleanup context health
- **`active change still in progress`** → `/mvt-resume` -- Resume work on the active change
- **`no active changes remain`** → `/mvt-analyze` -- Start a new feature

### Format

- `/{skill_name}` -- {when to use this skill, tailored to the current context}

Do not suggest the skill that was just completed. Prioritize skills that logically follow from the work done.
